#### What Can I mod?

###### 1. Images
The easiest thing todo is editing images.
||
Games like Job Job, or Survive the Internet feature Images
that can be edited. This tool features drag and drop so that you can 
easily switch out the lame default images with your juicy memes. Just
drag your image over an exsiting image and drop it. 
||
You even can select multiple images (Even 100+) and drag and drop it
over an images then the image you dragged it over and the next N (N=Amount of Images you dropped)
Images get overwritten.

###### 2. Prompts
Most games have prompts or question (E.g Zeeple Dome has no prompts)
Using the  differnt Editors talked in 'Editors' is it possible to change,
those prompts and questions. 
||
Keep in mind most games read out the prompts,
you may want to use the button on the Gameview that removes the narration on 
the game you modded those.

###### 3. Audio
The best example for Audio Modding is EarWax. Using the advanced drag and drop feature
you can use almost any audio and video file and convert it to an .ogg audio file
||
~~ All Jackbox Party Packs are using .ogg files for their audio this tool converts
your files into .ogg files

###### 4. More
~~ This section hopefully gets added oneday, but there is some major roadblock in decrypting .swf
~~ files from the games todo first, if this decryption is done alot, and I mean A LOT more can be modded
~~ in the future.
